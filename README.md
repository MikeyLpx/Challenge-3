# Random Passowrd Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
The motivation behind this project was to be able to create a new random password with the click of a button. The reason for the creation of this project was to become more profficient with Javascript and to add user interaction to the starter code. The problem that was solved with this Porject is that if you need to create a long password you can do it with the click of a few buttons. You can also determin what type of characters you want your password to have and how long it is depending on the restrictions of the password you want to create. What I learned is how to add strings and how to use for loops in order to create new strings.
